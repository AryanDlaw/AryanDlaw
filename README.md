ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Aryan Varma â€” a Product Manager with a strong technical foundation and a passion for building data-informed, user-centric products.

With a background in Information Technology and a Masterâ€™s degree from Arizona State University, Iâ€™ve worked across various tools and technologies to bring product ideas to life. During my time at ASU, I deepened my expertise in analytics, working hands-on with tools such as Tableau, Power BI, Python, SQL, and containerization platforms like Docker for scalable development and deployment.

I enjoy translating complex technical concepts into meaningful product decisions â€” and Iâ€™m always curious about how things work under the hood. On this GitHub, youâ€™ll find a blend of technical projects, product strategy experiments, and prototypes that reflect both my engineering skills and product thinking.

Letâ€™s build something great! ðŸš€
